# beget_additional_ip (Resource)

Additional public IP address resource. Can be ordered in a specific region and optionally attached to a compute instance.

## Attaching and Detaching

The `compute_instance_id` attribute controls IP attachment:

- **Set to a VPS ID**: IP is attached to that instance during creation or update
- **Set to `null` or omitted**: IP remains free (unattached)
- **Change the value**: IP is detached from the old instance and attached to the new one

## Example Usage
```terraform
# Order additional IP and attach it to a compute instance
resource "beget_additional_ip" "attached" {
  region              = "ru1"
  compute_instance_id = "8838e90e-5bfd-4cc5-9edc-550135c83800"
}

output "attached_ip" {
  value = {
    ip_address = beget_additional_ip.attached.ip_address
    region     = beget_additional_ip.attached.region
  }
}
```
```terraform
# Order additional IP without attaching to any instance
resource "beget_additional_ip" "free" {
  region = "ru1"
}

output "free_ip" {
  value = beget_additional_ip.free.ip_address
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `region` (String) Region where the additional IP is ordered. Changing this field will recreate the IP resource

### Optional

- `compute_instance_id` (String) Compute Instance ID to attach the IP to. If not specified or set to null, the IP remains unattached (free)

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Additional IP resource identifier. Automatically set to the IP address value
- `ip_address` (String) The allocated public IP address. Automatically assigned when the IP is ordered
